If an enemy picks up a heart it becomes stronger. Money will shoot out of it when you attack it.



Rideable enemy concept
- 6hp; big chungus duckie
- Starts with a leaf on his head. You can ride it by standing on the leaf
- You cannot dash into it from above when the leaf is on its head
- If you attack it normally, it will face the player, grab the leaf off its head and use it like a whip.
  Then it will put the leaf back on its head
- If you twirl attack it, it does a ground pound. The ground pound emits shockwaves

Why Mario blocks are good:
 - Utilise jump
 - Depend on your position
 - Reusable after being broken
 - May hold anything inside of them
 - Kill enemies that are standing on top of them

Why SoT blocks are good:
- Utlise jump and wall jump
- Break after platforming off them. Allow for puzzley room design.
- Can hold loot.

Goals:
- Break to access new areas
- Two attacks interact with it differently
- New way to interact with enemies
- Hide items
- Very simple and intuitive to interact with

Inspirations:
- SMW turn blocks
- SoT dirt
- SMM brick blocks when you have link powerup

Ideas:
- block is only destroyable by launching an enemy into it. Possibly needs to be explosive enemy.
- spinning on top of a block breaks it and boops you up.
  - Spinning into the side breaks it too
- The blocks move
- The blocks rotate - in which case different sides of the block could have different effects
  - Rotate the block by hitting it
- Make the block some noteable object with properties
  - Melon, fruit
- The timing you hit the block matters somehow
  - Changes colour
  - Dice numbers
- Tetris shaped blocks you can rotate by ledge clinging on
- Hit a button with your head that does something..
- Block is some living entity that speaks when you hit it. Freeze game, rotate block to along x axis to face player with a smile.
- Block is held in place by a spring.
  - Hitting it will send the block in the respective direction, then it will get yoinked back into place
- Variants of block: Some just break, others have special property
- 2HP mystery block. First hit removes dirt and reveals what kind of block it is.
  - Literally just breaks
  - Bouncy block
  - physics block you can chuck at enemies
