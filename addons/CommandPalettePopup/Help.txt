[color=aqua]All open scripts[/color] will be shown by default.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will show the open scenes. 
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will show all scripts, scenes and other files.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will show all scenes.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] (c as in Code file) will show all scripts.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will list all nodes of the current scene. Activating a node will select it in the scene tree dock. While the filter is active, you can add a new script to the currently selected node in the list. You can also open the signal connection dialog from this filter.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will list all project and editor settings. Activating one will open the setting and select the property. While the filter is active, you can add a new project setting by using the button besides the filter.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will list all properties from the inspector of the current node selection. Activating it will focus the property in the inspector.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will traverse the file tree.

[color=aqua]%s [/color] followed by a number will jump to that line in the script editor when activating the filter or ending the search_string with a space.
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will list the methods of the current script with the line number. Activating the method will jump to that line in the script.

Ending the search_string with  X (space + int), where X is an integer, will jump to the X-th item in the list.
Ending the search_string with [color=aqua]"  "[/color] (double space) while the filter for all files, settings or adding a setting is active, will autocomplete (part) of the path. When the "select a node" filter is active, it will select the node instead. Combine that with [color=aqua]%s [/color] to quickly edit properties with your keyboard.
Wildcards (*?) are allowed in the search_string. All spaces in the search_string will be replaced with a *.

Opening a script will switch to the scene tab the script is attached to. It only works, if the script is attached to the scene root. This will give you autocompletion on Node(Path)s and their methods.

While the popup is visible, pressing the shortcut again will switch to the last opened file. The two labels at the bottom show the current and the last file opened. 

A copy button to quickly copy the file, node or settings path to the clipboard is available. There is a "context" button to access the context menu (rmb click) of the selected item for the FileSystemDock, NodeDock and SceneTreeDock.

[color=aqua]%s [/color] will list the open text files (TextEditor plugin by [color=aqua]fenix-hub[/color]).
[color=aqua]%s [/color] will list the todo list (TODO plugin by [color=aqua]need12648430[/color]).
I have no affiliation with those plugins.
